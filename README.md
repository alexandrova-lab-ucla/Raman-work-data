# Raman work data

This is data from publication ‘What can Raman spectroscopy really say about the adsorbed CO on roughened Cu electrodes in CO2 electroreduction conditions? ’

This dataset includes the structural information used to evaluate the Raman intensity ratio, incorporating the effects of temperature dependence, surface facet variations, and CO adsorption site influences
